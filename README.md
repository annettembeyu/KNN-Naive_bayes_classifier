# Supervised learning- K Nearest Neighbours(KNN) and The Naive Bayes Classifier

## Overview
My project will entail perfoming the K Nearest Neighbours(KNN) and the Naive Bayes Classifier(each model will be on a separate notebook) on two different datasets which can be downloaded from the following links:

Dataset 1 Source: ~Train Dataset Source: [Link](https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv)
                  ~Test Dataset Source: [Link](https://archive.org/download/test1_202002/test%20%281%29.csv)]
                  
 Dataset 2 Source: ~[Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase]

## Experimental Procedure

- Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20  sets.

-Dataset 1 does not have the label for the test set, I will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then proceed to perform K-nearest neighbor classification.

-For dataset 2, I  will perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.

-Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).

-Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.

-I will then repeat the above four steps each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40 and copare the outcomes.

-Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques for the models.

-Provide further recommendations to improve the performance of  both classifiers
